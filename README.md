This is a personal project where I will analyse New York CitiBike Data and eventually create a model too.
So far, I have done some visualisations on Station Popularity and Time related visual analysis.
To download the data and try it for yourself, please help yourself to the public source data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html and make sure to download
links beginning with JC (Jersey City).
